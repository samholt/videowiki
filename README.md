## What is this repository for? ##

Have you ever wondered why there isnâ€™t a video version of Wikipedia already? Itâ€™s 2018, streaming images and videos isnâ€™t a big deal but Wikipedia is still predominantly a text-based encyclopedia.

**Okay, times up**

The reason for this is because videos once uploaded on the internet, cannot be edited again and Wikipedia relies on being continuously edited and updated.(Image uploading a video on YouTube, can you edit the video once you upload it? No, right?) The second major reason is that video-production is time-consuming and ðŸ’°.

VideoWiki cracks these technical challenges and proves that building a collaborative multi-media encyclopedia is possible.Anyone, including you, can edit (add images / gifs / videos) to any VideoWiki article, even without logging in.

At VideoWiki, we are a group of individuals who want to evolve Wikipedia from a text-based encyclopedia to a multi-media encyclopedia.
The future of Knowledge cannot be confined to text only. We, human beings perceive information visually and the sum of all human knowledge should also have a visual medium.
 
If you want to contribute to VideoWiki's development, jump right in :)
